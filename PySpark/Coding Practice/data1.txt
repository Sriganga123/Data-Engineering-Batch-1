Apache Spark is a lightning fast real-time processing framework. It does in-memory computations to analyze data in real-time. It came into picture as Apache Hadoop MapReduce was performing batch processing only and lacked a real-time processing feature. Hence, Apache Spark was introduced as it can perform stream processing in real-time and can also take care of batch processing.
